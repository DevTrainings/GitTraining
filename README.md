# Introduction

The main goal of this repository is to provide a hands-on introduction training
for GIT SCM.

After finishing all the tasks you should be able to perform all the usual GIT
operations and study more advance scenarios on your own.

# Prerequisites

* Create an account on [http://github.org](http://github.org).
  * This is necessary for later tasks related to parallel development (remotes
    repository).
* Install favorite _GIT_ command line tool.
  * You can use [GitHub for Windows](https://desktop.github.com/) which
    comes with the PowerShell integration.
  * Git for Windows (former mSysGit) can be used from cygwin.
  * Other people use it from PowerShell.
  * Commands should be always the same.
* This training uses PowerShell git somewhere, mSysGit (bash) somewhere
  else.
* They should be mostly equivalent.

# How to use this material

* You can either use it directly from the GitHub web site.
* Or just clone this repository and follow individual tasks.
  * You can use your favorite text editor with MarkDown plugin to see everything
    formatted.
* Feel free to submit PR to make this more useful/better :-).
